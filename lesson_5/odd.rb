# Given the following data structure, 
# return a new array containing the same sub-arrays as the original 
# but ordered logically by only taking into consideration the odd numbers they contain.

arr = [[1, 6, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9]]

new_arr = arr.sort do |a, b|

# The sorted array should look like this:
p new_arr == [[1, 8, 3], [1, 5, 9], [6, 1, 7], [1, 6, 9]]
